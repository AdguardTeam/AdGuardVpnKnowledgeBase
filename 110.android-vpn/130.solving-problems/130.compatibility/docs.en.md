# AdGuard VPN and AdGuard ad blocker: Compatibility mode
Starting from the [version 3.5](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-3-5-for-android.html) AdGuard ad blocker has compatibility mode with AdGuard VPN. The moment you have both apps installed, you receive a push notification, that says “Compatibility mode is enabled”. That’s it. Both apps recognise each other and instantly set up a seamless collaboration.

This is a mighty cool feature, because it allows you to use both VPN and ad blocker at the same time. Enjoy all benefits of VPN, stay 100 percent private and protected from ads. AdGuard VPN is the only VPN service that allows simultaneous work with AdGuard ad blocker. 

If you haven’t installed AdGuard VPN yet, you can do that right from the AdGuard ad blocker app. "Menu" — "Settings" — "AdGuard VPN ↓"

If for some reason you would like to turn Compatibility Mode off, just go to "Settings" "Advanced settings" - "Operating mode"
